# Gap Analysis: Package Comparison Report

## Executive Summary
The current package directory is failing when copied to node_modules because it lacks critical build artifacts and compiled native libraries that are present in the working directory (`/workspace_rust/@unomed/react-native-matrix-sdk`).

## Critical Differences Found

### 1. **Android Build Artifacts (MISSING - CRITICAL)**
The working directory contains extensive Android build artifacts that are completely absent from the current package:

#### Missing Build Directories:
- `android/.cxx/` - CMake build cache and compiled objects
- `android/build/` - Gradle build outputs including:
  - Compiled `.dex` files
  - Native library intermediates
  - Kotlin compiled classes
  - Generated JNI bindings

#### Impact:
Without these build artifacts, the Android app cannot find the compiled native modules and will crash at runtime.

### 2. **Native Libraries (.so files)**
**Current Package:** Only has pre-built FFI libraries in:
- `android/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libmatrix_sdk_ffi.so`
- `android/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libmatrix_sdk_ffi.so`

**Working Directory:** Has complete set of compiled libraries:
- `libunomed-react-native-matrix-sdk.so` (JNI wrapper - MISSING!)
- `libjsi.so` (React Native JSI bridge)
- `libreactnative.so` (React Native core)
- `libfbjni.so` (Facebook JNI utilities)
- `libc++_shared.so` (C++ standard library)
- `libmatrix_sdk_ffi.so` (Rust FFI library)

### 3. **File Differences**

#### Files only in current package:
- `.claude/` - Claude configuration (not needed)
- `LICENSE` - License file
- `ReactNativeMatrixSdk.podspec` - iOS pod specification
- `react-native.config.js` - React Native configuration
- `scripts/` - Build scripts directory

#### Files only in working directory:
- 7,400+ build artifact files including:
  - Compiled object files (`.o`)
  - CMake cache files
  - Ninja build files
  - Compiled Kotlin/Java classes
  - Generated JNI headers

### 4. **Minor Content Differences**
- `tsconfig.json`: 1 byte difference (likely trailing newline)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why the working directory works:
1. **It has been built**: The gradle build process has been executed
2. **Native libraries are compiled**: The C++ JNI wrapper linking React Native to Rust is compiled
3. **All dependencies are resolved**: Build process resolved and included all required libraries

### Why the current package fails:
1. **Missing JNI wrapper library**: `libunomed-react-native-matrix-sdk.so` is not present
2. **No build artifacts**: Package appears to be source-only without compilation
3. **Incomplete native setup**: Only FFI libraries present, missing React Native bridge libraries

## Solution

To make the current package work, you need to:

### Option 1: Include Pre-built Libraries
1. Copy all `.so` files from the working directory's build output:
   ```bash
   # Copy native libraries
   cp -r ~/workspace_rust/@unomed/react-native-matrix-sdk/android/build/intermediates/library_jni/debug/copyDebugJniLibsProjectOnly/jni/* \
         ./android/src/main/jniLibs/
   ```

### Option 2: Build on Installation
1. Ensure the package builds when installed in node_modules
2. Add a postinstall script to package.json:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "postinstall": "cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug"
   }
   ```

### Option 3: Publish Complete Package
1. Build the package first:
   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```
2. Include build outputs in the published package
3. Update `.npmignore` to NOT exclude critical build files

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fix**: Copy the missing native libraries from the working directory
2. **Long-term**: Set up proper build process during npm install
3. **Testing**: Always test the package by installing it fresh in a new project before publishing

## Files to Copy for Quick Fix

```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p android/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a
mkdir -p android/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a

# Copy ARM64 libraries
cp ~/workspace_rust/@unomed/react-native-matrix-sdk/android/build/intermediates/library_jni/debug/copyDebugJniLibsProjectOnly/jni/arm64-v8a/*.so \
   android/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/

# Copy ARMv7 libraries
cp ~/workspace_rust/@unomed/react-native-matrix-sdk/android/build/intermediates/library_jni/debug/copyDebugJniLibsProjectOnly/jni/armeabi-v7a/*.so \
   android/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/
```

This should resolve the immediate issue and make the package functional when copied to node_modules.
