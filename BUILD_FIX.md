# Build Process Analysis & Fix

## The Problem

You're missing a critical build step! The build process you followed:
1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn prepare` (only builds JS/TS files via Bob)
3. `export NDK path`
4. `yarn generate:release` (only builds Rust FFI, NOT the C++ JNI wrapper)

**Missing Step:** You never compiled the C++ JNI wrapper library!

## What Each Step Actually Does

### Your Current Process:
1. **`yarn install`** - Installs npm dependencies
2. **`yarn prepare`** - Runs `bob build` which only compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
3. **`yarn generate:release`** - Runs:
   - `ubrn build android --release` - Builds Rust code → `libmatrix_sdk_ffi.so` ✅
   - Generates Java/Kotlin bindings ✅
   - **DOES NOT** build C++ JNI wrapper ❌

### What's Missing:
The C++ JNI wrapper (`libunomed-react-native-matrix-sdk.so`) that bridges React Native to your Rust library is built by CMake during the Android Gradle build process, which you never ran!

## The Working Directory Success:
The working directory (`/workspace_rust/@unomed/react-native-matrix-sdk`) works because someone ran the Android build there, creating:
- `.cxx/` directory with CMake build artifacts
- `build/` directory with compiled native libraries
- Most importantly: `libunomed-react-native-matrix-sdk.so`

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Build Native Libraries (Recommended)
```bash
# From your package directory
cd android

# Build the native libraries using gradle
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Or if no gradle wrapper exists, use system gradle
gradle assembleDebug

# The built libraries will be in:
# android/build/intermediates/library_jni/debug/copyDebugJniLibsProjectOnly/jni/
```

### Solution 2: Copy Pre-built Libraries (Quick Fix)
```bash
# Copy all compiled native libraries from working directory
cp -r ~/workspace_rust/@unomed/react-native-matrix-sdk/android/build/intermediates/library_jni/debug/copyDebugJniLibsProjectOnly/jni/* \
      android/src/main/jniLibs/
```

### Solution 3: Fix Package Publishing Process
Modify your release process to include native library compilation:

1. Update `package.json` scripts:
```json
"scripts": {
  "generate:release": "yarn generate:release:rust && yarn build:native:android",
  "generate:release:rust": "yarn generate:release:android && yarn generate:release:ios",
  "build:native:android": "cd android && gradle assembleRelease && yarn copy:native:libs",
  "copy:native:libs": "cp -r android/build/intermediates/library_jni/release/copyReleaseJniLibsProjectOnly/jni/* android/src/main/jniLibs/"
}
```

2. Or add native library compilation to postinstall:
```json
"postinstall": "patch-package && node scripts/download-binaries.js && cd android && gradle assembleDebug"
```

## Why package.json Excludes Build Artifacts

The `files` field in package.json intentionally excludes `!android/build` because:
- Build artifacts are usually large
- They're platform/architecture specific
- They should be built on the target machine

However, for React Native packages with native code, you need to either:
1. Include pre-built native libraries in `android/src/main/jniLibs/`
2. Build them during package installation
3. Have the app's build process handle it

## Complete Fix Command Sequence

```bash
# 1. Build the native libraries
cd android
gradle assembleDebug  # or ./gradlew if wrapper exists

# 2. Copy built libraries to jniLibs
cd ..
mkdir -p android/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a
mkdir -p android/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a
mkdir -p android/src/main/jniLibs/x86
mkdir -p android/src/main/jniLibs/x86_64

cp android/build/intermediates/library_jni/debug/copyDebugJniLibsProjectOnly/jni/arm64-v8a/*.so \
   android/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/

cp android/build/intermediates/library_jni/debug/copyDebugJniLibsProjectOnly/jni/armeabi-v7a/*.so \
   android/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/

# 3. Now the package will work when copied to node_modules!
```

## Verification

After fixing, you should have these files:
```
android/src/main/jniLibs/
├── arm64-v8a/
│   ├── libmatrix_sdk_ffi.so (already present)
│   ├── libunomed-react-native-matrix-sdk.so (NEW - critical!)
│   ├── libjsi.so (NEW)
│   ├── libreactnative.so (NEW)
│   ├── libfbjni.so (NEW)
│   └── libc++_shared.so (NEW)
└── armeabi-v7a/
    └── (same files as above)
```

The key missing piece was `libunomed-react-native-matrix-sdk.so` - the JNI wrapper that connects React Native's JavaScript to your Rust code!
